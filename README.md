# Cribbage
*A simulator of the card game cribbage for 2 players.*

Cribbage is a card game I grew up playing and still enjoy playing. It's a game that relies heavily on luck and somewhat on strategy over two phases. Find out more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cribbage).

Having a new opponent of late, I found myself testing out new strategies of playing. I was curious if I could first write a simulator for this somewhat complex game and second if I could use it to determine the perfect cribbage strategy.

## Process
To get started, I set up and tested a class to automate generating the deck and dealing 6 random cards to the 2 players as well as selecting a cut card.

## Next
This is very much a work in progress and only the initial deal has been coded. I now have several more classes and functions to write to count hand values, discard to the crib based on values and strategy, lay out, and keep score.

Once the simulator is ready, I'll need to determine how exactly to assess the different strategies. I'm also generally a bit curious about basic stats like average hand, pegging, and crib scores and how many hands are typical to win (and therefore whether or not the first person with a crib has a significant advantage).
